# todo
A basic todo program in C.

After completing my postgrad and using Java a lot, I wanted to start messing about with C. It's a language I really really enjoy. This thing's nothing special at all and it isn't even connected to a database right now.. so I mean, I guess if you close the program, all of your tasks are magically completed! A real time-saver.
